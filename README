This Haskell Source Code was created to find out
if a number is near divisible by 7. A number is near-divisible
if and only if when one digit is removed, the number left over is
divisible by 7. This was created as an NFA model.

This code can be executed with runhaskell or manually loaded into ghci.
The main function to call is mod7.
